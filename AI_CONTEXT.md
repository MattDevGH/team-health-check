## Project

Team Health Check — a lightweight feedback tool for delivery teams, inspired by the Spotify Squad Health Check Model. Collects regular health-check responses via web interface and Slack bot, visualises trends over time.

**Repo:** [Replace with GitHub URL]
**Branch:** master (single branch, push directly)

## Architecture

```
Route Handler (thin) → Service (business logic) → Repository (data access) → Prisma → SQLite
```

- **Repository pattern**: Services depend on repository interfaces, not Prisma directly
- **Factory injection**: `createXService({ xRepo, yRepo })` — no DI container
- **In-memory fakes**: For unit tests, services use in-memory repository implementations
- **Typed errors**: All errors extend `AppError` base class with `code` and `statusCode`

## Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Repository interfaces between services and Prisma | Enables TDD with sub-ms tests using in-memory fakes |
| Factory functions for DI (no container) | Simple, explicit, appropriate for project size |
| Thin route handlers | SRP — no business logic in API routes |
| Materialised aggregates at session close | Enables GDPR data deletion without affecting trends |
| Lazy materialisation via scheduler tick | Survives serverless function timeouts (no setTimeout) |
| In-memory rate limiting | Avoids TOCTOU race condition, no SQLite write contention |
| date-fns-tz for scheduling | DST-safe UTC calculation for session open/close times |
| Genesis flow with CAS token | Atomic team creation for unknown emails, prevents double-submit |
| Session links + Magic links (no OAuth) | Minimises friction for feedback submission |
| Vercel + Turso (no containers) | Zero-ops deployment, SQLite compatibility preserved |
| Resend for email | Simple, free tier sufficient, Vercel integration |
| Zod for validation | Runtime type safety, co-located schemas |
| fast-check for property tests | Formal correctness properties from design doc |

---

## Development Workflow (TDD)

1. Write failing test (Red)
2. Write minimal code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor (clean up, both test and production code)
4. Repeat

**Watch mode**: `npm run test:watch` — runs unit tests only (fast feedback)
**Full suite**: `npm test` — includes property tests
**E2E**: `npx playwright test` — runs against built app

## Testing Layers

| Layer | Tool | Speed | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|-------|
| Unit (services) | Vitest + in-memory repos | <1ms/test | Business logic |
| Property | Vitest + fast-check | ~100ms/property | Correctness invariants |
| Integration | Vitest + real SQLite | ~50ms/test | Data layer, full flows |
| UI/A11y | Vitest + RTL + jest-axe | ~100ms/test | Components, WCAG |
| E2E | Playwright | ~2-5s/flow | Browser user flows |

## CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Install → Lint → Type Check → Unit+Property Tests → Build → E2E Tests

All stages must pass. Branch protection requires CI green before merge.

---

## Conventions

- Conventional commits: `feat:` `fix:` `test:` `docs:` `chore:`
- File naming: kebab-case
- Functions/variables: camelCase
- Types/components: PascalCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Max file length: 200 lines preferred, extract at 300
- Max function length: 30 lines
- Imports grouped: external → internal → relative (blank lines between)
- No circular imports between service modules
- JSDoc only for exported public APIs

---

## Spec Status

Full spec at `.kiro/specs/team-health-check/`:
- `requirements.md` — 20 requirements + 4 NFRs (complete)
- `design.md` — Architecture, data models, 34 correctness properties, testing strategy, SOLID, TDD (complete)
- `tasks.md` — Not yet generated

---

## Outstanding Work

- Generate task list from design
- Implement domain model (replace placeholder Item schema)
- Build service layer with repository pattern
- Expand CI pipeline (lint, typecheck, e2e stages)
- Add Playwright, fast-check, zod, date-fns-tz dependencies
